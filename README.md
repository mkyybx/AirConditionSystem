# AirConditionSystem
A simulation of a distributed air-conditioning system and its billing system

## The requirement of the project

A hotel is pursuing the concept of energy saving and environmental protection, thus implementing self-service billing central air conditioning system. The central air-conditioning system allows the occupants to set the temperature and adjust the wind speed as required, while the central air-conditioning system can also display the amount of the energy consumed and the amount to be paid. In addition, the hotel needs to give each room a detailed list of air conditioning usage, to facilitate customersâ€™ checkout and production of statistical reports.

## The system consists of three sub-systems:

* **Center**: Simulating the central air conditioning machine and billing.
* **Client**: Simulating the distributed vent in the guest room.
* **ClientAgent**: A web server allowing occupants to access to control their own distributed vents at the guest room.
