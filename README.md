# AirConditionSystem
A simulation of a distributed air-conditioning system and its billing system

Here is the requirement of the project:
A hotel is pursueing the concept of energy saving and environmental protection, thus implementing self-service billing central air conditioning system. The central air-conditioning system allows the occupants to set the temperature and adjust the wind speed as required, while the central air-conditioning system can also display the amount of the energy consumed and the amount to be paid. In addition, the hotel needs to give each room a detailed list of air conditioning usage, to facilitate customers checkout and production of statistical reports.

The system consists of three sub-systems:
Center: Simulating the centural air conditioning machine and billing.
Client: Simulating the distributed vent in the guest room.
